Use case 2: Using the OSF as a data store for a GitHub-based project
====================================================================

Imagine you are a PhD student and want to collaborate on a fun little side
project with a student at another institute. It is quite obvious for the two of
you that your code will be hosted on GitHub_. And you also know enough about
DataLad_, that using it for the whole project will be really beneficial.

But what about the data you are collecting?
The Dropbox is already full (`DataLad third party providers <http://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/basics/101-138-sharethirdparty.html>`_).
And Amazon services don't seem to be your best alternative.
Suddenly you remember, that you got an OSF_ account recently, and that there is this nice `Datalad extension <https://github.com/datalad/datalad-osf/>`_ to set up a `Special Remote`_ on OSF_.

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^
For installation checkout the :ref:`installation page <install>`.



Creating an Example Dataset
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As a very first step you want to set up a DataLad dataset. For this you should
run. In all examples a `$` in front indicates a new line in the Bash-Shell,
copying it will prevent your code from execution.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ datalad create collab_osf

After having created the dataset we want to populate it with some content (just like in the `DataLad Handbook`_).
Importantly we don't want to upload this file on GitHub, only on OSF - in the real world this could be your data that is too large to upload to GitHub.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd collab_osf
    $ datalad download-url http://www.tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/Bash-Beginners-Guide.pdf \
    --dataset . \
    -m "add beginners guide on bash" \
    -O books/bash_guide.pdf

And we also want to add a text file, which will be saved on GitHub_ - in your case this could be the code you are using.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ mkdir code
    $ cd code
    $ echo "This is just an example file just to show the different ways of saving data in a DataLad dataset." > example.txt
    $ datalad save --to-git -m "created an example.txt"

We now have a dataset with one file that can be worked on using GitHub and one that should be tracked using `git-annex`.

Setting up the OSF Remote
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To use OSF as a storage, you need to provide either your OSF credentials or an OSF access token.
You can create such a token in your account settings (`Personal access token` and then `Create token`), make sure to create a `full_write` token to be able to create OSF projects and upload data to OSF.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ export OSF_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN_FROM_OSF.IO

We are now going to use datalad to create a sibling dataset on OSF with name `osf` - this will create a new OSF project entitle `OSF_PROJECT_NAME` on the OSF account associated with the OSF token in `$OSF_TOKEN`.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ datalad create-sibling-osf -s osf --title OSF_PROJECT_NAME

Setting up GitHub Remote
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We can set-up a GitHub Remote with name `github` and include a publish dependency with OSF - that way, when we publish our dataset to GitHub, the data files get automatically uploaded to OSF.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ datalad create-sibling-github REPRONAME -s github --github-login GITHUB_NAME --publish-depends osf
    $ datalad publish . --to github --transfer-data all

This will publish example.txt in code/ to GitHub and only add the folder structure and symbolic links for all other file; at the same time it will upload the data to OSF - this way you can let OSF handle your data and GitHub your code.
